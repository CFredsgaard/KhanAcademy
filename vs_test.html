            This webpage is useful when picking colors to style your html. A lot of colors have been given names like
            <em style="color:purple;">purple</em>,
            <em style="color: green;">green</em>,
            <em style="color: blue;">blue</em> or
            <em style="color: red;">red</em>, but when looking for more variation not all colors have been named and it is here that HTML color codes comes in handy.</p>
        <p>
            They make it easy to play around to find the perfect color using their color picker, which in turn gives you the needed information on the color in hexidecimal, RGB, HSL and CYMK.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site also helps you with matching up your chosen color with its complemetary-, triadic-, tetradic-, analogous- and neutral colors along with, tints, shades and tones making it much easier to style a bautiful webpage of your own.

            Playing with fonts is a great way to spice up your website, in css there are already a few fonts to choose between like
            <span style="font-family: ariel;">Ariel</span>,
            <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Sans-Serif</span>,
            <span style="font-family: serif;">serif</span> and
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">Monospace</span>, but if you want something a bit more fun you can look up fonts on the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            My favorite site for finding new fonts is google's font page, this site also helps you by recoing fonts that go well togenter with the one you have picked.
        </p>
        <p>
            All you have to do is:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a font you like and click on it</li>
            <li>Embed the link in the head of your HTML file</li>
            <li>Add the name of the font to the appropriate place in yor css style sheet</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            HTML is no fun without a bit of CSS styling and the possibilities for styling are nearly endless. A good example of this is the CSS Zen Garden website, all the pages are done with the
            <strong>exact</strong> same HTML file, the only thing that has been changed is the CSS file but the webpages look very different.
            <br> To learn about the differet styling elemnts that have been used right click on the object you want to see the code of and choose 'inspect'
        </p>
        <p>
            The HTML and CSS files can be downloaded to look at making it possible to try and make your own layout for the CSS Zen Garden file
